## cache-suspense

learning next js server action cache & suspense. Encountered errors when adding to an existing app

- may have been related to improper use of async functions / returns in jsx?
- had similar errors here when I ommitted 'await' in async functions in server components - no compile-time errors!

Made from create-next-app.
